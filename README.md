# Jax-Algos

Welcome to my JAX learning repository! ðŸš€

This repository serves as a personal learning journey where I implement various Machine Learning
and Deep Learning algorithms using JAX. The main goal is to better understand both the algorithms
and JAX's powerful capabilities.

## Purpose

- Learn JAX fundamentals and best practices
- Implement classic ML/DL algorithms from scratch
- Explore JAX's automatic differentiation and JIT compilation features
- Document my learning process and insights

## Work in Progress

This is an active learning repository, and content will be added gradually as I progress through
different algorithms and concepts.

Feel free to explore and learn alongside me!
